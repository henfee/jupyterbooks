However, there is an issue with the standard implementation of the notebook server software that does not account for more than one person working on a notebook at the same time. The notebook server software is the underlying Jupyter software that displays the page and interacts with the user-it&#xA0;follows the directions in your notebook for display and interaction.</p><p>A notebook server, really a specialized internet web server, typically creates a new path or thread of execution for each user to allow for multiple users. A problem comes up when a lower level subroutine, used for all instances, does not properly account for multiple users where each has their own set of data.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>Some of the coding/installs of this chapter may not work in a Windows environment.</p></div></div><p>In this chapter, we will do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We will give an example of the issue that occurs when multiple users access the same notebook in a standard Jupyter installation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We will use a new version of Jupyter, JupyterHub, that was built by extending upon Jupyter to specifically address the multiple user problem</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We will also use Docker, a tool to allow for multiple instances of any software, to address the issue</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Sample interactive notebook"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec61"/>Sample interactive notebook</h1></div></div></div><p>For this chapter, we will use a simple notebook that asks the user for some information and displays other information.</p><p>For example, we could have a script such as this (taken from&#xA0;
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;7.&#xA0;Sharing and Converting Jupyter Notebooks">Chapter 7</a>
, <span class="emphasis"><em>Sharing and Converting Jupyter Notebooks</em></span>):</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>from ipywidgets import interact</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>def myfunction(x):</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    return x</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>interact(myfunction, x= "Hello World ")</strong></span>
</pre><p>The script presents a textbox to the user with the original value of the box containing the <code class="literal">"Hello World"</code> string. As the user interacts with the input field and changes the value, the value of the variable <code class="literal">x</code> in the script changes accordingly and is displayed on screen. For example, I have changed the value to the letter <code class="literal">A</code>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_001.jpg" alt="Sample interactive notebook"/></div><p>
</p><p>We can see the multiuser problem if we just open the same page in another browser window (copy the URL, open a new browser window, paste in the URL, and hit <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>)-we get the exact same display pulling up the last checkpoint. The new window should have started with a new script, just prompting you with the default <code class="literal">"Hello World"</code> message. However, since the Jupyter server software is only expecting one user, there is only one copy of the variable <code class="literal">x</code>, so it displays its value.</p></div></div></body></html>
