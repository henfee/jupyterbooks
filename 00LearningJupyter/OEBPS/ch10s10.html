First, we installed the Spark additions to Jupyter on a Windows machine and a Mac machine. We wrote an initial script that just read lines from a text file. We went further and determined the word counts in that file. We added sorting to the results. There was a script to estimate Pi. We evaluated web log files for anomalies. We determined a set of prime numbers. And we evaluated a text stream for some characteristics.</p></div></body></html>
