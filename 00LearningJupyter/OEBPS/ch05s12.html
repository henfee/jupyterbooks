We saw some of the limitations of using JavaScript in Jupyter. We had a look at examples of several packages that are typical of Node.js coding, including <code class="literal">d3</code> for graphics, <code class="literal">stats-analysis</code> for statistics, built-in JSON handling, <code class="literal">canvas</code> for creating graphics files, and <code class="literal">plotly</code> used for generating graphics with a third party tool. We also saw how multi-threaded applications can be developed using Node.JS under Jupyter. Lastly, we saw how to use machine learning to develop a decision tree.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will see how to create interactive widgets that can be used in your notebook.</p></div></body></html>
