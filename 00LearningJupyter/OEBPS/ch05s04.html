As such, it was built to be able to manipulate HTML elements on the page. Several packages have been developed to further this feature, even creating a web server, especially using extensions such as Node.js.</p><p>The use of any of the HTML manipulation and generation features inside of Jupyter runs into a roadblock since Jupyter expects to control presentation to the user.</p></div></body></html>
