Some books about jupyter

This is a project to translate the book "Learning Jupyter" to Chinese Laungage.
I unzip the book's epub file into a unzip folder, and it's organized as htmls pages, so I then turn the html as jupyter notebook to do the translate.

I will try use the google translate API or Microsoft Or IBM Wason API to do the translate.

there are some good python pageages to help html to markdown, and bs4 for html --> content into .ipynb (json format)
